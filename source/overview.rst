*General Overview for DGETS SysAds*

The DGETS sysad Guide will assist UTAS personnel on how to install, configure
and maintain DGETS servers around the world.

Analysts can utilize DGETS to align SYERS-2 imagery to more accurately locate
their tasked geo-coordinates and focus on critical areas within the scene
relating to their EEI.


.. note::
   Incorrectly using or not using SYERS-2 DGETS capabilities available can
   have a negative effect on reporting. More importantly, it could seriously
   jeopardize on-going ground operations, due to EEI related observables
   not being correctly reported
