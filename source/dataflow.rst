Basic Data Flow
===============
There are two main DGETS servers (ECH & WCH). The data will come into DGS-1 and DGS-2 
and then be disseminated near-realtime to ECH (from DGS-1) and WCH (from DGS-2)

Web Tiles, Target Query jpegs, Full Resolution NITFs will be available shortly after
reaching the DGETS servers (time of availability dependent on processing, mission load, etc.)
